# Clustering_Prediction_Healthcare
Clustering &amp; Prediction for Healthcare Dataset of Allegheny County

## Overview
On https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/ , the University of Wisconsinâ€™s Population Health
Institute has published rankings of all 3142 counties in the US by their health outcomes and
behaviors. In class, we described some exploratory data analysis on the underlying data from
2017. In this assignment, you will apply clustering and prediction techniques to the data from
2022 to determine if there are interesting groupings of counties with similar health outcomes
and behaviors, and develop a predictive model to see which factors influence health outcomes.
Individuals and governments can use such a model segment the population and improve public
health outcomes.

## Tasks
The data file for you to analyze is in the assignment in Canvas and also available at
